<h1>Sam's Current Hobbies</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Fishing</li>
        <p>Fresh or salt water, it doesn't matter to me.  I run a family club called "The Virginia Fishing Initiative.</p>
    <li>Music</li>
        <P>I love music! I love the guitar work done in the 50-70's, real bluesy.  I play the guitar, mandolin, and harmonica. when I'm not working or fishing I'm usually playing1</P>
    <li>Gaming</li>
        <p>My gaming tastes have changed over the years.  First person shooters have said "bye Bye" to me.  I do enjoy games like Solastra, Baulder's Gate (any of them), World of Warcreft, etc.</p>
    <li>Aquariums</li>
        <p>I built saltwater aquriums for about 15 years.  I loved them. I had to give them up because I didn't have the time to propperly care for them. I recently started back with planted aquariums. Se the picture below and let me know what you think.</p>
